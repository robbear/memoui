/**
 * Mixin which maps a click (actually, a mousedown) to an item selection.
 *
 * This simple mixin is useful in list-like elements like [ListBox](ListBox),
 * where a click on a list item implicitly selects it.
 *
 * The standard use for this mixin is in list-like elements. Native list
 * boxes don't appear to be consistent with regard to whether they select
 * on mousedown or click/mouseup. This mixin assumes the use of mousedown.
 * On touch devices, that event appears to trigger when the touch is *released*.
 *
 * This mixin only listens to mousedown events for the primary mouse button
 * (typically the left button). Right-clicks are ignored so that the browser
 * may display a context menu.
 *
 * Much has been written about how to ensure "fast tap" behavior on mobile
 * devices. This mixin makes a very straightforward use of a standard event, and
 * this appears to perform well on mobile devices when, e.g., the viewport is
 * configured with `width=device-width`.
 *
 * This mixin expects the component to provide an `items` property. It also
 * expects the component to define a `state.selectedIndex` member; you can
 * provide that yourself, or use [SingleSelectionMixin](SingleSelectionMixin).
 *
 * If the component receives a clicks that doesn't correspond to an item (e.g.,
 * the user clicks on the element background visible between items), the
 * selection will be removed. However, if the component sets
 * `state.selectionRequired` to true, a background click will *not* remove the
 * selection.
